# Side-Channel Pulsar Analysis

## Introduction

### What is a Side-Channel Attack?
  
### Project Goals

- **Pulsar signals** are periodic electromagnetic pulses from rotating neutron stars. This behavior reveals patterns in high noise environments, and can be an effective model in understanding side-channel techniques.
- The primary [objectives](#project-results) of this project are as follows:
  1. What techniques can detect data leakage in signals?
	2. How does scrambling level and the SNR affect pulsar data leakage?
	3. Can an attacker determine the seed used to obfuscate the signal?

### Seed Recovery / Brute-Force Attack

#### Goal

- An attack was simulated where an attacker attempts to recover the scrambling seed using **brute force.**
- **The following assumptions were made:**
  - The attacker has access to the obfuscated signal.
  - The attacker knows the potential obfuscation methods being used.
